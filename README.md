# Snake and Ladder
This is a simple terminal version of classic snake nad ladder game.I made it for basics of computer course in university and it is my first c++ project.I tried my best to write code with good-readability and learned manythings from it.
# Game Features
Highly customizable.You can define number of snakes , ladders , cells and players.

It uses an implemention of BFS algorithm to find shortest path from player P to last cell(I wrote an implemention of djikstra algorithm for fun too).

colorful with graphical table and simple animations thanks to ANSI escape sequences(some enviornments may or may not support all of them).

# libraries/frameworks used:
-SDL2 : playing dice sound and background music.Background music is from Mount and Blade : With Fire and Sword.
